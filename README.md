# Hi, I'm Ilgın Tandoğan

CTIS student focused on **DevOps & Cloud technologies**. I enjoy building reproducible infrastructure setups, automating workflows, and learning Kubernetes-based operations.

## What I focus on
- Kubernetes (k0s / k0sctl), Ingress, basic cluster operations
- Docker & containerization
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Linux fundamentals, networking basics, troubleshooting

## Featured projects
- **K0s Cluster Setup (Single & Multi-Node)**  
  Documentation + configuration examples (k0s / k0sctl), reset/backup notes, common issues & fixes.
